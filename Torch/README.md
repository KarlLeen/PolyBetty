# Torch — Light Up The Chain



Torch is a strategy-driven, onchain launch protocol built for high-performance chains like Monad. It transforms token launches into a competitive game with **mint thresholds**, **burn-to-win rewards**, and **automated liquidity** — all in one frictionless flow.


## Features

- **Round-based Launch Flow**

  Mint tokens in multiple rounds with time limits and funding thresholds.

- **Burn Leaderboard Mechanism**

  Participants compete by burning tokens to earn rewards.

- **Auto Liquidity Injection**

  Upon meeting mint thresholds, liquidity is automatically created via integrated DEX router.

- **Permissionless Deployment**

  Anyone can deploy a new launch with configurable parameters.



## Smart Contract Structure



| **Contract**     | **Description**                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| TorchFactory.sol | Main factory to create new Torch launch rounds |
| TorchGame.sol    | Core round logic: mint, burn, claim, settle    |
| TorchToken.sol   | Erc20 tokens                                   |
| Interfaces/      | external interfaces (e.g., router)             |
